\section*{Divisibility}
\textbf{Question.} All numbers divisible by both [[A]] and [[B]] are also divisible by which of the following?

\textbf{Answer.} [[ANSWER]]

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A number is divisible by another number (a divisor) if its prime factorization contains the prime factorization of the divisor.
  \item The prime factorization of [[A]] is [[getPrimeFactorization( A ).join( "\textbackslash\{\}$\times$" )]].
  \item The prime factorization of [[B]] is [[getPrimeFactorization( B ).join( "\textbackslash\{\}$\times$" )]].
  \item So, any number divisible by both must have [[LCM\_FACTORIZATION.join( "\textbackslash\{\}$\times$" )]] as part of its prime factorization.
  \item All numbers which divide such a number will have a factorization which is part of [[LCM\_FACTORIZATION.join( "\textbackslash\{\}$\times$" )]].
  \item The prime factorization of [[ANSWER]] is [[getPrimeFactorization( ANSWER ).join( "\textbackslash\{\}$\times$" )]].
  \item Since [[getPrimeFactorization( ANSWER ).join( "\textbackslash\{\}$\times$" )]] is part of [[LCM\_FACTORIZATION.join( "\textbackslash\{\}$\times$" )]], all numbers which are divisible by [[A]] and [[B]] are also divisible by [[ANSWER]].
\end{itemize}
