\section*{Converting between point-slope and slope-intercept form}
\textbf{Question.} Convert the following equation from point slope to slope intercept form.

\textbf{Answer.} y = \textbackslash\{\}space3\textbackslash\{\}space $\cdot$ x + \textbackslash\{\}space-5

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Distribute the 3 in the 3(x - 3) term on the right.
                    y - 4 = \textbackslash\{\}blue\{*,3,x - 9\}
  \item Isolate the y term on the left by
                        
                        adding 4 to both sides.
                    
                    y = *,3,x - 9 + 4
  \item Combine the constant terms on the right.
                    y = *,3,x + -5
                    The equation is now in slope-intercept form, with a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of -5.
\end{itemize}
