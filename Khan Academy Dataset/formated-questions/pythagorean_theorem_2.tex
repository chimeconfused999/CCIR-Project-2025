\section*{Special right triangles}
\textbf{Question.} In the right triangle shown, AC = BC = [[AC]].
                What is AB?

\textbf{Answer.} [[AC * AC * 2]]

\textbf{Hints.}

                    What is the relationship between the sides of a 30 - 60 - 90 triangle?
  \item This is a 30-60-90 triangle with a hypotenuse of length 1.
  \item The ratio of AB : BC is 1 : $\frac{1}{2}$.
  \item Therefore, $\frac{x}{[[BC + BCrs]]}$ = $\frac{1}{\frac{1}$\{2\}\} = 2.
  \item x = 2 $\cdot$ [[BC + BCrs]]
  \item x = [[BC * 2 + BCrs]]

                    What is the relationship between the sides of a 30 - 60 - 90 triangle?
  \item This is a 30-60-90 triangle with a hypotenuse of length 1.
  \item The ratio of AB : AC is 1 : \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{$\sqrt{3}$\}\{2\}.
  \item Therefore, $\frac{x}{[[AC + ACrs]]}$ = $\frac{1}{\frac{\sqrt{3}$\}\{2\}\} = $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}$\}.
  \item x = $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}$\} $\cdot$ [[AC + ACrs]]
  \item x = $\frac{[[2 * AC]]}{\sqrt{3}$\}
                    x = $\frac{[[2 * AC]]}{\sqrt{3}$\} $\cdot$ \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{$\sqrt{3}$\}\{$\sqrt{3}$\}
                    x = \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{[[2 * AC]] $\cdot$ $\sqrt{3}$\}\{3\}
  \item So, x = [[ABs]].
