\begin{itemize}
  \item The volume is measured by counting the number of cubic [[plural\_form(UNIT)]].
  \item Carefully count the cubes. Some of the cubes might be hidden behind other cubes. Try to visualize all of the cubes.
  \item The volume of a shape can be measured by the number of cubic [[plural\_form(UNIT)]] that make up the shape.
  \item There are [[max(max(LENGTH, WIDTH), HEIGHT)]] cubes.
  \item The volume is [[max(max(LENGTH, WIDTH), HEIGHT)]] 3.
\end{itemize}
