\textbf{Question.} 

\textbf{Answer.} Alex

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Who has the largest number of [["<img src='" + Khan.imageBase + "badges/" + BADGE\_ID + "-small.png'>"]] symbols next to his name in the chart?
  \item Who has the largest number of [["<img src='" + Khan.imageBase + "badges/" + BADGE\_ID + "-small.png'>"]] symbols next to her name in the chart?
  \item Alex has the largest number of symbols next to his name.
  \item Alex has the largest number of symbols next to her name.
  \item Alex earned the most [["<img src='" + Khan.imageBase + "badges/" + BADGE\_ID + "-small.png'>"]] badges.
  \item Who has the smallest number of [["<img src='" + Khan.imageBase + "badges/" + BADGE\_ID + "-small.png'>"]] symbols next to his name in the chart?
  \item Who has the smallest number of [["<img src='" + Khan.imageBase + "badges/" + BADGE\_ID + "-small.png'>"]] symbols next to her name in the chart?
  \item Alex has the smallest number of symbols next to his name.
  \item Alex has the smallest number of symbols next to her name.
  \item Alex earned the fewest [["<img src='" + Khan.imageBase + "badges/" + BADGE\_ID + "-small.png'>"]] badges.
  \item The key at the bottom of the pictograph shows that each symbol represents [[\_.indexOf( DATA, Math.max.apply( Math, DATA ) )]] badges.
  \item Find Alex's row in the table:
                    
                        Alex1
  \item There are [[DATA[PERSON]]] symbols.
  \item [[DATA[ PERSON ]]] [[plural\_form( SYMBOL, DATA[ PERSON ] )]]
                         $\times$  [[\_.indexOf( DATA, Math.max.apply( Math, DATA ) )]] badges per symbol
                         = [[DATA[ PERSON ] * VALUE\_PER\_IMG]]
                        [[plural\_form( BADGE\_PL, DATA[ PERSON ] * VALUE\_PER\_IMG )]]
  \item Alex earned [[ANSWER]] [["<img src='" + Khan.imageBase + "badges/" + BADGE\_ID + "-small.png'>"]] badges.
