\section*{Similar triangles 1}
\textbf{Question.} Which triangles are similar to triangle A?

\textbf{Answer.} [[ANSWER\_SHOW]]

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two triangles are similar if their angles are congruent (equal).
  \item We see that triangle A has angles of [[MAIN[ 0 ]]] and [[MAIN[ 2 ]]]. The third angle is therefore 180 - [[MAIN[ 0 ]]] - [[MAIN[ 2 ]]] = [[MAIN[ 1 ]]]
  \item Triangle B has angles of [[B[ 0 ]]] and [[B[ 1 ]]]. The third angle is 180 - [[B[ 0 ]]] -  [[B[ 1 ]]] = [[B[ 2 ]]].
                    
                        Therefore triangle B is not similar to triangle A.
                    
                        Therefore triangle B is similar to triangle A.
  \item Triangle C has angles of [[C[ 0 ]]] and [[C[ 2 ]]]. The third angle is 180 - [[C[ 0 ]]] -  [[C[ 2 ]]] = [[C[ 1 ]]].
                    
                        Therefore triangle C is not similar to triangle A.
                    
                        Therefore triangle C is similar to triangle A.
