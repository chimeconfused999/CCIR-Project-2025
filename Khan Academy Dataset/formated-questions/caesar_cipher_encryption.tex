\section*{Caesar cipher encryption}
\textbf{Question.} Alex decides he wants to encrypt his name with a Caesar Cipher,
                            using a shift of 25.
                        
                            What will his name look like after he encrypts it?
                        
                    
                        
                            Alex decides she wants to encrypt her name with a Caesar Cipher,
                            using a shift of 25.
                        
                            What will her name look like after she encrypts it?

\textbf{Answer.} [[applyCaesar(M\_LOWER, SHIFT)]]

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We want to take each letter of the name and shift it right by 25.
  \item If we take the first letter A and shift it right by 25, we get the letter
                z.
  \item If we take the second letter l and shift it right by 25, we get the letter
                k.
  \item Continuing this for each letter, the final cipher output is “[[applyCaesar(M\_LOWER, SHIFT)]]”
\end{itemize}
