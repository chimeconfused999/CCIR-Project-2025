\textbf{Question.} You are given two dice to roll. One is black with six sides; the other is white with four sides.
            
            
                You are given two six-sided dice to roll.
            
        
        
        
        If it helps, you may select the matching outcomes below. Your selections
        aren't checked with your answer:

        
            0 of 24 selected

\textbf{Answer.} 0.375

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There are
                9 matching
                outcomes.
  \item The probability is the number of matching outcomes divided by all possible outcomes.
  \item The probability is $\frac{3}{8}$,
            which reduces to 3, 8.
  \item The probability is 3, 8.
  \item How many matching outcomes are there with an even number on the black die and
                    3 on the white die?
  \item How many matching outcomes are there with an odd number on the black die and
                    3 on the white die?
  \item For each value on the black die, is there a value on the white die that adds to 3?
  \item Count all outcomes that are less than or equal to 3.
  \item Remember that both dice can be 1 ("at least one").
\end{itemize}
