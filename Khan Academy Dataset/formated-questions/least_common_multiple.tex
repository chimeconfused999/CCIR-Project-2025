\section*{Least common multiple}
\textbf{Question.} What is the least common multiple of [[A]] and [[B]]?
                    Another way to say this is:
                    \textbackslash\{\}lcm([[A]], [[B]]) = \{?\}

\textbf{Answer.} [[LCM]]

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The least common multiple is the smallest number that is a multiple of [[A]] and [[B]].
  \item We know that [[A]] $\times$ [[B]] (or [[PRODUCT]]) is a common multiple,
                but is it the least common multiple?
  \item Write out the multiples of [[BIGGER]] until we find a number divisible by [[SMALLER]].
  \item [[M]],
  \item So, the least common multiple of [[A]] and [[B]] is [[LCM]].
\end{itemize}
