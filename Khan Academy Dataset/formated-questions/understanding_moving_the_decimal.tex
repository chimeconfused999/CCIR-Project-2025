\textbf{Question.} How many times do you need to multiply 4.6136 by ten to get 461.36?
                    
                        How many times do you need to divide 4.6136 by ten to get 461.36?

\textbf{Answer.} 2

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Moving the decimal one position to the right is the same as multiplying by ten once.
  \item Moving the decimal one position to the left is the same as dividing by ten once.
  \item Thus, moving the decimal right 2 times is the same as multiplying by ten 2 times, or multiplying by 100:
                \{4.6136\} * \{100\} = \{461.36\}
  \item You need to multiply by ten 2 times.
                    
                
                    
                        You need to divide by ten 2 times.
\end{itemize}
