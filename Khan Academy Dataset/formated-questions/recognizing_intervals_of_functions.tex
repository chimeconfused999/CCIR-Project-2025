\section*{Increasing and decreasing intervals of functions}
\textbf{Question.} 

\textbf{Answer.} Move the orange window to select part of the function.
        
        
            graph.slidingWindow.getX()
        
        
            var correct = \_.reduce(\_.range(guess, guess + 1, 0.02), function(correct, x) \{
                return correct \&\& PREDICATE(x);
            \}, true);
            if (!graph.moved \&\& !correct) \{
                return ""
            \}
            return correct;
        
        
            graph.slidingWindow.moveTo(guess, 0);

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbackslash\{\}blue\{f(x)\} is increasing in an interval if in that interval,
                    when x is increasing, \textbackslash\{\}blue\{f(x)\} is increasing.
  \item The intervals
                        where \textbackslash\{\}blue\{f\} is increasing
                        are
                        highlighted above.
  \item Select any part of the function that is highlighted.
  \item \textbackslash\{\}blue\{f(x)\} is decreasing in an interval if in that interval,
                    when x is increasing, \textbackslash\{\}blue\{f(x)\} is decreasing.
  \item The intervals
                        where \textbackslash\{\}blue\{f\} is decreasing
                        are
                        highlighted above.
  \item Select any part of the function that is highlighted.
\end{itemize}
