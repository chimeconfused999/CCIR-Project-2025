\textbf{Question.} What is 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of 20?

\textbf{Answer.} 300

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Having 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of something means that you get
                        30 out of every 100.
  \item We can set up a proportion to find out what number is
                            30\textbackslash\{\}\% of 20:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}\}
  \item Which things do we know, and what are we trying to find?
  \item We know the \textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\} is 30.
                        Is 20 the \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}
                        or the \textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}?
  \item The 20 is the \textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}.
                            We are trying to find the \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}
                            that makes up 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of it:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{30\}\}\{100\} = \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{20\}\}
  \item If we multiply the denominator of the fraction on the left by 10,
                            it will be the same denominator of the fraction on the right.
                            To keep things equal, let's also multiply the numerator on the left by 10:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{30\} $\times$ 10\}\{100 $\times$ 10\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{20\}\}
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{300\}\}\{20\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{20\}\}
                        
                        \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}blue\{300\} = \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}
  \item So 300 is 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of 20.
  \item Having 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of something means that you get
                        30 out of every 100.
  \item We can set up a proportion to find out what number is
                            30\textbackslash\{\}\% of 20:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}\}
  \item Which things do we know, and what are we trying to find?
  \item We know the \textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\} is 30.
                        Is 20 the \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}
                        or the \textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}
                    ?
  \item The 20 is the \textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}.
                            We are trying to find the \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}
                            that makes up 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of it:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{30\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{20\}\}
  \item If we divide the denominator of the fraction on the left by 5, it will be the same denominator of the fraction on the right.  To keep things equal, let's also divide the numerator on the left by 5:
                        \textbackslash\{\}qquad $\frac{\color{blue}{30}$ \textbackslash\{\}div 5\}\{100 \textbackslash\{\}div 5\} = $\frac{\color{[[PINK]]}{\text{part}$\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}color\{[[GREEN]]\}\{20\}\}
                        \textbackslash\{\}qquad $\frac{\color{blue}{6}$\}\{20\} = $\frac{\color{[[PINK]]}{\text{part}$\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}color\{[[GREEN]]\}\{20\}\}
                        \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}color\{blue\}\{6\} = \textbackslash\{\}color\{[[PINK]]\}\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}
  \item So 6 is 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of 20.
  \item Having a percent of something means that you get that percent out of every 100.
  \item We can set up a proportion to find out what percent of 20
                            we need to take to get 300:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}\}
  \item Which things do we know, and what are we trying to find?
  \item We are trying to find the \textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}.
                        Is 20 the \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}
                        or the \textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}?
  \item The 20 is the \textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}.
                            This means the \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\} is 300:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{300\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{20\}\}
  \item If we divide the denominator of the fraction on the right by 10,
                            it will be the same denominator of the fraction on the left.
                            To keep things equal, let's also divide the numerator on the right by 10:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{300 \textbackslash\{\}div 10\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{20 \textbackslash\{\}div 10\}\}
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{30\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{2\}\}
                        
                        \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\} = \textbackslash\{\}pink\{30\}
  \item So 300 is 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of 20.
  \item Having a percent of something means that you get that percent out of every 100.
  \item We can set up a proportion to find out what percent of 20
                            we need to take to get 6:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}\}
  \item Which things do we know, and what are we trying to find?
  \item We are trying to find the \textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}.
                        Is 20 the \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\}
                        or the \textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}?
  \item The 20 is the \textbackslash\{\}green\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{whole\}\}.
                            This means the \textbackslash\{\}pink\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{part\}\} is 6:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{6\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{20\}\}
  \item If we multiply the denominator of the fraction on the right by 5,
                            it will be the same denominator of the fraction on the left.
                            To keep things equal, let's also multiply the numerator on the right by 5:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{6 $\times$ 5\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{20 $\times$ 5\}\}
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\}\}\{100\} =
                            \textbackslash\{\}dfrac\{\textbackslash\{\}pink\{30\}\}\{\textbackslash\{\}green\{100\}\}
                        
                        \textbackslash\{\}qquad \textbackslash\{\}blue\{\textbackslash\{\}text\{percent\}\} = \textbackslash\{\}pink\{30\}
  \item So 6 is 30\textbackslash\{\}\% of 20.
\end{itemize}
