\textbf{Question.} Is \textbackslash\{\}large\{272575\} divisible by
        10?

\textbf{Answer.} Yes

\textbf{Hints.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Any even number is divisible by 2.
  \item 272575 is even, so it is
                    divisible by 2.
  \item 272575 is odd, so it is
                    not divisible by 2.
  \item A number is divisible by 10
                        if the sum of its digits is divisible by
                        10.
                        [Why?]
                    
                    
                        
                            First, we can break the number up by place value:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad$\begin{aligned}
                            \blue{272575}=
                            &&\blue{2}$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$100000+ \\&&\blue{7}$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$10000+ \\&&\blue{2}$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$1000+ \\&&\blue{5}$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$100+ \\&&\blue{7}$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$10+ \\&&\blue{5}$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$1
                            \end{aligned}$
                        
                        
                            Next, we can rewrite each of the place values as
                            1 plus a bunch of 9s:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad$\begin{aligned}
                            \blue{272575}=
                            &&\blue{2}(99999+1)+ \\&&\blue{7}(9999+1)+ \\&&\blue{2}(999+1)+ \\&&\blue{5}(99+1)+ \\&&\blue{7}(9+1)+ \\&&\blue{5}
                            \end{aligned}$
                        
                        
                            Now if we distribute and rearrange, we get this:
                        
                        
                            \textbackslash\{\}qquad$\begin{aligned}
                            \blue{272575}=
                            &&\gray{2$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$99999}+ \\&&\gray{7$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$9999}+ \\&&\gray{2$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$999}+ \\&&\gray{5$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$99}+ \\&&\gray{7$\textbackslash\{\}cdot$9}+ \\&&
                            \blue{2}+\blue{7}+\blue{2}+\blue{5}+\blue{7}+\blue{5}
                            \end{aligned}$
                        
                        
                            Any number consisting only of 9s is
                            a multiple of 10, so
                            the first [[cardinalThrough20(integerToDigits(NUMBER)
                            .length - 1)]] terms must all be multiples of
                            10.
                        
                        
                            That means that to figure out whether the original
                            number is divisible by 10
                            , all we need to do is add up the digits
                            and see if the sum is divisible by
                            10. In other words,
                            \textbackslash\{\}blue\{272575\} is divisible
                            by 10 if \textbackslash\{\}blue\{
                            2\}+\textbackslash\{\}blue\{7\}+\textbackslash\{\}blue\{2\}+\textbackslash\{\}blue\{5\}+\textbackslash\{\}blue\{7\}+\textbackslash\{\}blue\{5\} is divisible by
                            10!
  \item Add the digits of [[STEP.num]]:
                    
                        [[STEP.digits.join("+")]] =
                        [[STEP.sum]]
                    
                    
                        If [[STEP.sum]] is
                        divisible by 10, then
                        [[STEP.num]] must also be
                        divisible by 10.
  \item [[\_.last(STEPS).sum]] is divisible
                    by 10, therefore
                    \textbackslash\{\}blue\{272575\}
                    must also be divisible by 10.
  \item [[\_.last(STEPS).sum]] is not divisible
                    by 10, therefore
                    \textbackslash\{\}blue\{272575\}
                    must not be divisible by 10.
  \item A number is divisible by 4 if the last
                        two digits are divisible by 4.
                        [Why?]
                    
                    
                        
                            We can rewrite the number as a multiple of
                            100 plus the last two digits:
                        
                        \textbackslash\{\}qquad
                        \textbackslash\{\}gray\{2725\}
                        \textbackslash\{\}blue\{75\} =
                        \textbackslash\{\}gray\{2725\}
                        \textbackslash\{\}gray\{00\} +
                        \textbackslash\{\}blue\{75\}
                        
                        
                            Because 272500 is a multiple of 100,
                            it is also a multiple of 4.
                        
                        
                            So as long as the value of the last two digits,
                            \textbackslash\{\}blue\{75\},
                            is divisible by 4, the original
                            number must also be divisible by 4!
  \item Is the value of the last two digits,
                    75,
                    divisible by 4?
  \item Yes,
                    \textbackslash\{\}blue\{75 \textbackslash\{\}div 4 =
                    18.75\}, so
                    272575 must also be divisible by
                    4.
  \item No, 75 is not
                    divisible by 4, so
                    272575 is also not divisible by
                    4.
  \item A number is divisible by 5 if the last
                    digit is a 0 or a 5.
  \item The last digit of 272575 is
                    5, so yes
                    272575 is divisible by
                    5.
  \item The last digit of 272575 is
                    5, so no
                    272575 is not divisible by
                    5.
  \item A number is divisible by 10 if the last
                    digit is a 0.
  \item The last digit of 272575 is
                    5, so yes
                    272575 is divisible by
                    10.
  \item The last digit of 272575 is
                    5, so no
                    272575 is not divisible by
                    10.
  \item 272575 is divisible by
            10 if it can be divided by
            10 without leaving a remainder.
