<h1 class="unnumbered" id="independent-probability">Independent
probability</h1>
<p><strong>Question.</strong> If you flip a coin and roll a 6-sided die,
what is the probability that you will flip a [[HT]] and roll
[[RESULT_DESC]]?</p>
<p><strong>Answer.</strong> [[0.5 * RESULT_POSSIBLE.length / 6]]</p>
<p><strong>Hints.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Flipping a [[HT]] and rolling [[RESULT_DESC]] are independent
events: they don’t affect each other. So, to get the probability of both
happening, we just need to multiply the probability of one by the
probability of the other.</p></li>
<li><p>The probability of flipping a [[HT]] is <span
class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The probability of rolling [[RESULT_DESC]] is <span
class="math inline">\frac{[[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]]}{6}</span>, since
there is [[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]] outcome which satisfy our condition
(namely, [[toSentence(RESULT_POSSIBLE)]]), and 6 total possible
outcomes.</p>
<p>The probability of rolling [[RESULT_DESC]] is <span
class="math inline">\frac{[[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]]}{6}</span>, since
there are [[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]] outcomes which satisfy our
condition (namely, [[toSentence(RESULT_POSSIBLE)]]), and 6 total
possible outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>The probability of rolling [[RESULT_DESC]] is <span
class="math inline">\frac{[[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]]}{6}</span>, since
there is [[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]] outcome which satisfies our
condition (namely, [[toSentence(RESULT_POSSIBLE)]]), and 6 total
possible outcomes.</p>
<p>The probability of rolling [[RESULT_DESC]] is <span
class="math inline">\frac{[[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]]}{6}</span>, since
there are [[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]] outcomes which satisfies our
condition (namely, [[toSentence(RESULT_POSSIBLE)]]), and 6 total
possible outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>So, the probability of both these events happening is <span
class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> <span
class="math inline">\cdot</span> <span
class="math inline">\frac{[[RESULT_POSSIBLE.length]]}{6}</span> = <span
class="math inline">\frac{[[PRETTY_N]]}{[[PRETTY_D]]}</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We know that \{}blue{[[SINGLE_PCT]] \{}%} of the time, he’ll make
his first shot.</p>
<p>Then [[SINGLE_PCT]] \{}% of the time he makes his first shot, he will
also make his second shot, and [[localeToFixed((1-PROB)*100, 0)]] \{}%
of the time he makes his first shot, he will miss his second shot.</p>
<p>Notice how we can completely ignore the rightmost section of the line
now, because those were the times that he missed the first free throw,
and we only care about if he makes the first and the second. So the
chance of making two free throws in a row is [[SINGLE_PCT]]\{}% of the
times that he made the first shot, which happens [[SINGLE_PCT]]\{}% of
the time in general.</p>
<p>This is [[SINGLE_PCT]]\{}% <span class="math inline">\cdot</span>
[[SINGLE_PCT]]\{}%, or [[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]] <span
class="math inline">\cdot</span> [[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]] \{}approx
[[localeToFixed(PROB*PROB, 3)]].</p>
<p>We can repeat this process again to get the probability of making
three free throws in a row. We simply take [[SINGLE_PCT]]\{}% of
probability that he makes two in a row, which we know from the previous
step is [[localeToFixed(PROB*PROB, 3)]] \{}approx
\{}purple{[[TWO_PCT]]\{}%}.</p>
<p>[[SINGLE_PCT]]\{}% of \{}purple{[[TWO_PCT]]\{}%} is
[[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]] <span class="math inline">\cdot</span>
[[localeToFixed(PROB * PROB, 3)]] \{}approx [[localeToFixed(PROB_CUBED,
3)]], or about \{}green{[[THREE_PCT]]\{}%}:</p>
<p>There is a pattern here: the chance of making two free throws in a
row was [[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]] <span
class="math inline">\cdot</span> [[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]], and the
probability of making three in a row was [[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]]
<span class="math inline">\cdot</span> [[localeToFixed(PROB * PROB, 3)]]
= [[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]] <span class="math inline">\cdot</span>
([[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]] <span class="math inline">\cdot</span>
[[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]]) = [[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]]^3.</p>
<p>In general, you can continue in this way to find the probability of
making any number of shots.</p>
<p>The probability of making [[STREAK]] free throws in a row is
[[localeToFixed(PROB, 2)]] ^ [[STREAK]].</p></li>
<li><p>We know that \{}blue{[[SINGLE_PCT]] \{}%} of the time, he’ll miss
his first shot (100 \{}% - [[localeToFixed(PR*100, 0)]] \{}% =
[[SINGLE_PCT]] \{}%).</p>
<p>Then [[SINGLE_PCT]] \{}% of the time he misses his first shot, he
will also miss his second shot, and [[localeToFixed((1-PROB)*100, 0)]]
\{}% of the time he misses his first shot, he will make his second
shot.</p>
